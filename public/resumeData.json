As I traversed different projects, I actively bounced between Frontend and Backend tasks looking to gain a practical understanding of an application's architecure. My current challenge is learning about React.js and discovering the benefits it presents as a frontend framework.",

With other courses such as Data Structures, Computer Architerures, Web & Mobile Application Development, and Intro to Security, it's hard not to value my time studying under UT's Computer Science department.

When I write a new poem, its an opportunity to get in touch with my subconscious and then explore how my brain makes decisions or connections to create meaning. The editing processes isn’t just the process of improving a poem, but a chance to analyze the connections my brain had made and question why it did so. Overall, Creative Writing to me is a way to challenge my self-awareness and explore new ways of thinking either through editing or reading the work of other writers."

          "My time with The Home Depot is where I’ve found the most growth as a Software Engineer. While on the Performance Engineering team, I've developed tools to support Site Reliability Engineers as they monitor and improve The Home Depot’s site health. Our team of three engineers developed from scratch an incidents and changes tracking tool using Python with Flask for the backend and Javascript with jQuery for our frontend. My tasks ranged from implementing automation for Site Availability calculations to frontend development of tabular metrics. As the primary frontend developer of the application, I was tasked with implementing Request For Change and Blameless Postmortem form submissions which included auto-populate, typeahead, validation, session storage, and cloning functionality.",
          "I’ve also contributed to the Frontend ReactJS rewrite of our Reliability Engineering Hub. This application includes multiple dashboards each displaying unique metrics regarding The Home Depot orders and site health. For this rewrite, I handled the initial UX research on our older application. This involved conducting direct interviews with our primary customers, studying our Google Analytics, as well as completing a Card Sort study for our new navigation. During development, I was tasked with handling the rewrite of 7 out of 22 different pages requiring the use of table, graph, and pie chart components.",
          "Being on this team has come with incredible opportunities. I’ve worked intimately with our UX team to design new and old pages, I’ve paired with both Senior Frontend and Backend Engineers to implement features, and even had the “luxury” of handling emergency hotfixes to resolve production issues ranging from database failures to session caching problems involving Kubernetes clusters. It has been a rollercoaster of opportunity and growth that I truly appreciate."
