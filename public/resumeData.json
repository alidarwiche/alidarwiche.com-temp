As I traversed different projects, I actively bounced between Frontend and Backend tasks looking to gain a practical understanding of an application's architecure. My current challenge is learning about React.js and discovering the benefits it presents as a frontend framework.",

I distinctly remember solving my first task at The Home Depot using my knowledge of floating-point arithmetic gained from an Operating Systems course. With other courses such as Data Structures, Computer Architerures, Web & Mobile Application Development, and Intro to Security, it's hard not to value my time studying under UT's Computer Science department. Whether it be exploring authentication through oAuth and JWT tokens or discussing API contracts that follow RESTful practices, I find myself constantly in touch with those initial lectures introducing me to these every day topics."

I found myself most engaged with courses that allowed me to practice oral and written communication or exploring topics of marketing, management, and entrepreneurship. I value my time in this program as it has helped me understand how business infrastructure and innovative technologies can work together to support a customer’s needs."

When I write a new poem, its an opportunity to get in touch with my subconscious and then explore how my brain makes decisions or connections to create meaning. The editing processes isn’t just the process of improving a poem, but a chance to analyze the connections my brain had made and question why it did so. Overall, Creative Writing to me is a way to challenge my self-awareness and explore new ways of thinking either through editing or reading the work of other writers."
