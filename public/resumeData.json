    "bio":"I first began coding as a Full Stack Software Engineer two years ago. My main goal as an new developer was gaining a broad understanding of Mobile and Web Application development. As I traversed different projects, I actively bounced between Frontend and Backend tasks looking to gain a practical understanding of an application's architecure. My current challenge is learning about React.js and discovering the benefits it presents as a frontend framework.",
